                            In the 21st century, technology has become an integral part of daily life, revolutionizing
                            the way we communicate, work, learn, and live. Its pervasive influence has touched every
                            aspect of modern society, from healthcare and education to commerce and entertainment. While
                            it has brought immense benefits, it also poses significant challenges, including ethical
                            dilemmas, privacy concerns, and social inequality. This essay explores the multifaceted
                            impact of technology on society, examining its benefits and drawbacks in key areas.
